This is Food Space, a game I developed for an XNA class at Columbia College Chicago.

It was made using C# and Monogame, which is a library using Microsoft's XNA4.

The player controls a spaceship and the goal of the game is to dodge the various foods coming the player's way.

The player can also pick up powerups which can be used to protect him/herself.
